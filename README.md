Objective: This technical report explores Register-based datasets from the Demobel database, developed and supplied by Statbel (Statistics Belgium). 
Our first contribution is to propose a new typology of household composition that pays more attention to complex categories, such as non-married partners, same-sex unions/families and multigenerational households. 
Our second contribution is the detailed description of our strategy to identify union formations and dissolutions based on administrative data. 
In sum, this report provides an example of how partnership biographies can be reconstructed based on the residential information in administrative data, documenting both the challenges and strengths of this dataset and the choices made.
